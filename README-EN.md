## Function: validate_token

**Location**: `decorator.py`

**Description**: This function is a decorator used to validate a token. It checks if the token is valid and if the user has the required role to access a certain resource. If the token is invalid or the user does not have the required role, the function will raise an exception.

**Parameters**:

- `role` : This parameter specifies the role that is required to access a certain resource. The function checks if the token has the required role.

**Returns**: This function does not return a value. Instead, it modifies the behavior of the function it decorates.

**Usage as a Decorator**:

The `validate_token` function can be used as a decorator to protect routes or functions that require a user to have a certain role. Here is an example of how to use it:

```python
@validate_token('admin')
def protected_route():
    # This route can only be accessed by users with the 'admin' role
    print("Access granted.")
